Hello!

To build and run my solution, just run ant in this directory. You should see something like to following towards the end:

run:
     [echo] Running against sample1.csv
     [java] Simulating file: a.txt
     [java] Vector<0,1,NORTH>
     [java] Simulating file: b.txt
     [java] Vector<0,0,WEST>
     [java] Simulating file: c.txt
     [java] Vector<3,3,NORTH>


Cheers!
